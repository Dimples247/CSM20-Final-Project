The following will be a complete catalog of all loaded assets.

[Hide Jacket]
	description> A simple jacket made of deer hide. It is very thin in some places and no longer provides the protection it once did, but it's warm and you look damn good in it.
	type> armor
	amount> 1
[Leather Armor]
	description> A set of hide armor fit for the average adventurer
	type> armor
	amount> 2

[Tattered Cloth Armor]
	description> It looks well used, but it's made of thick, sturdy cloth
	type> armor
	amount> 1
[Brass Key]
	description> A very tarnished brass key. There are no locks in sight, so It's probably not useful for anything.
	type> item
[Lesser Potion of Healing]
	description> A strange liquid that seems to emanate life force. Drinking it might help heal your wounds.
	type> consumable
	amount> 4
[Auranya Eisenal]

	type> npc

	type> enemy
	health> 3
	inventory> Rusty Dagger, 
[Jeff]
	description> You begin to inspect yourself. You look down at your arms as you inspect your hands, then down at your legs as you shuffle your feet around. Isn't it strange how they move? You note the various muscles contracting in precise patterns to create the simple movements you are making. You are quite awestruck at the complexity of the human physiognomy, but to the average outsider, you currently look like a moron who's confused by their own hands.
	type> player
	health> 20
	inventory> Hide Jacket, 
[Small Hunting Knife]
	description> A small knife, intended for skinning and dressing game, but in a pinch, it makes a reasonable weapon.
	type> weapon
	amount> 2
[Rusty Dagger]
	description> A small, rusty blade, with many nicks in it's edge. It could hardly be described as a knife anymore, but it can still cause harm to the unfortunate soul who rosses its path.
	type> weapon
	amount> 1
[cottage]
	description> You are in a cozy cottage. A light glow from the hearth illuminates an otherwise dark woom.
	type> location
	npcs> 
	loot> Leather Armor,
